## Windows:

> If you want to use this bash script on Windows and you have *[WSL](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/)* you can follow the instructions for **Linux**.

I tested this with [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and it works well, first you would have to install **Git bash** on your computer, then you'd have to install [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases) for windows and put the exe file in a folder so it can to be included in the $PATH variable, e.g. `[GIT BASH FOLDER]\mingw64\bin` (Usually `C:\Program Files\Git`), finally you can run the script just make sure its has the execute bit on.

### git clone
```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch main --depth 1 https://github.com/Noam-Alum/lpi_010_160_exam.git
cd lpi_010_160_exam/
chmod +x lpi.sh

# ! Make sure you followed the instructions above !
```

# Usage

You can execute the script by simply running:
```bash
./lpi.sh
```
> You must have **jq** installed!

<br>

Then you should get the first question of the bunch, e.g. :
```
noam ◈ noam ⊛ lpi_010_160_exam ⊛ ❯❯ ./lpi.sh
